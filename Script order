# Order of scripts:
# 1: nmeastream -> makes a stream of NMEA data *
# 2: skymask -> puts a sky mask over the data
# 3: arcbuilder -> creates arcs
# 4: waterlevel -> creates water level arcs
# 5: waterlevelestimator -> estimates water level from previous arcs

The above is the order that the scripts will be used in the pipeline.
NMEAStream produces a data stream that is then fed into the SkyMask,
which in turn directs the tool where to search for data.

The masked data is then fed into the SatArcBuilder to create arcs and
then into WaterLevelArc to produces specifically water level arcs that
are then used into the waterlevelestimator to get a time series.

Overall the pipeline needs a general inspection for mistakes in direction
or in general.

# * will later be updated to use simulated data feed from another tool
